**This controls what shows on your site!**

1. Open `config.js` in your code editor
2. Look at the `features:` section
3. Current settings (good defaults!):
   ```javascript
   testimonials: false,    // Hidden (you don't have reviews yet)
   contactForm: false,     // Hidden (form not set up yet)
   calendly: true,         // Visible (ready to use!)
   ```
4. Keep these for now - we'll enable more later!

### 1. Deploy the Website (10 min)
1. Go to **netlify.com** and sign up (free)
2. Click "Add new site" → "Import from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub repo

4. **Open `config.js` file**
5. Find the `calendly:` section
6. Replace `skyviewdynamics` with YOUR Calendly username:
   ```javascript
   calendly: {
       url: 'https://calendly.com/YOUR-NAME/consultation',
   }
   ```
