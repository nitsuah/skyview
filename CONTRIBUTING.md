## 🛠️ Development Setup

Skyview is currently a static site built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- A text editor (VS Code recommended)

Since this is a static site, you can simply open `index.html` in your browser.
For a better experience (hot reloading), use a simple server:

```bash
# If you have python installed
python3 -m http.server

# Or using VS Code Live Server extension
```

## 📝 Coding Standards
